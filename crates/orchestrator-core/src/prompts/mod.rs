//! The prompt text totsuka injects into claude / codex / opencode (#313).
//!
//! Built-in defaults live in the embedded [`defaults.toml`], not in Rust string
//! literals, so rewording what an agent is told is an edit to a data file
//! rather than a code change (epic #311). This module parses that file once and
//! renders each template on demand.
//!
//! It sits alongside [`tool`](crate::tool) rather than under
//! [`config`](crate::config) because it needs both the config schema (once
//! overrides land) and [`domain::signal`](crate::domain::signal)'s marker
//! constants, and `config` deliberately knows nothing about `domain`.
//!
//! # What is configurable and what is not
//!
//! The prose that *teaches* the marker convention is data. The convention
//! itself is not: [`MARKER_COMPLETED`] and friends are the wire format that
//! `on-stop.sh` (bash) and `totsuka-opencode.js` parse, and per
//! [ADR-0020](https://github.com/tomoya-k31/totsuka/blob/main/docs/decisions/adr-0020-status-marker-stays.md)
//! the marker is the one completion signal shared by all three tools. Prompt
//! text changes what the model is *told*; it never changes what *runs*.
//!
//! [`defaults.toml`]: https://github.com/tomoya-k31/totsuka/blob/main/crates/orchestrator-core/src/prompts/defaults.toml
